# TrafficDashboard

TrafficDashboard is a single-page application that visualizes campus traffic data collected from various sensors (such as cameras and radars).

## What I Learned 
- TailwindCSS intallation and integration in a javascript frontend project.
- ECharts library integration to create simple dynamic data visualizations.
- Practiced Component-Based Design by breaking down the UI into reusable components.
- Creating basic charts like pie chart and bar chart, with dynamic data input.
- Using Leaflet Maps, and working and focusing dynamically on pinned locations.
